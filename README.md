Naming Conversion:
	
	'UpperCamelCase names', the first letter should be capitalised (eg. TcpClient)
	'snake_case names', there should be no capitalisation (eg. tcp_client)
	'SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE names', the name should be completely capitalised (eg. TCP_CLIENT)

Rustfmt is designed to be very configurable and it format your code in a particular style.
